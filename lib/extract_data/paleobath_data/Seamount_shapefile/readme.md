# README for Johansson_etal_2018_VolcanicProvinces_v2_NW-edit
Modified by Nicky Wright for the LIP reconstruction workflow.

This folder contains the compilation of volcanic provinces from Johansson et al. (2018; doi:10.1029/2017GL076691), i.e. from the GPlates 2.3 sample data.

The following edits have been made to this *specifically* for the LIP reconstruction workflow:
    - removed all features that are not oceanic volcanic provinces (i.e. retaining seamounts only)
    - removed all features that are reconstructed via the LIP_shapefile
    - Age of Tuamotus has been modified from 0 Ma to ~47 Ma, based on the age ref given by J18. In cases where this would mean it actually erupts on the Nazca Plate, the age has been modified to 33 Ma (so that it erupts on the Pacific side of the EPR.)
